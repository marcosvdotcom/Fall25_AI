        "text": "What is AI? At it’s core, generative AI is still just traditional computing, just with a lot more processor power. Online large language model AI’s, such as ChatGPT, run your request to a physical warehouse where there are many thousands of graphic cards powering servers, which then run the HUGE calculations necessary to analyze your input and formulate a conversational response, all using prediction. Different models are trained on different datasets, and weigh your input, referred to as a “token”, differently once it enters the AI’s decision making matrix. A key difference between models is the secret recipes they use to weigh tokens, which shapes how the model replies. A NVIDIA graphic processing chip, as is commonly used in data centers. AI Data center What’s the big deal about probability? AI computing is different in that it works off a prediction and probability model, versus a calculation or computation. Think of the difference between a discipline like statistics, versus computation or arithmetic. In computational thinking, for instance 2+3=5, the computer performs a fixed operation to a set outcome - it adds 2+3 and equals this to 5. You never get a different answer, and in fact you wouldn’t want to! A probabilistic software, like most generative AI, would instead look at how often 2+3 equaled 5, according to occurrences in it’s training data, and based on the probabilities it learned there, it would make predictions, or educated guesses. Because of this, if the AI has been trained on data that says 2+3 equals 17, or “cat”, or “pink zebra”, that information will always override the true answer of “5”. At present (Fall 2025), generative AI models are always guessing. In fact, it turns out large language models use strategies similar to standardized test takers, because these models are rewarded for guessing confidently, even with incorrect or made-up information, rather than creating the equivalent of a blank answer and saying “I don’t know.” What is AI not? Alive Thinking Generative, it remixes things it has already seen and by definition cannot truly create anything Much of the language around AI conveys a sense of intelligence, thinking, or even life. It’s important to remember that AI is not alive, does not possess consciousness, and is not able to think, hallucinate, or even lie, as that would require consciousness. These words instead describe our human experience and interpretation of what is essentially a sophisticated probability simulator."

        "title": "AI & Academic Research",
        "text": "How should AI should be used in the research process? First, you should consult whatever the boundaries set by your professor for your particular class and assignment are. Some faculty may have policies against any AI use during the research or writing process. Secondly, you should think about your own boundaries and ethics of AI use. Modern academic was established well before the advent of AI, so it’s certainly not strictly necessary for you to engage with to be a successful academic researcher and writer. However, many students will be thinking about how they might use AI in their future workplaces, and of course many folks will want to use it to help with research. Just like someone else can’t work out and build your body for you, academic work is intended to build your actual brain muscle/connections in the form of research, critical thought, analysis, expression/communication, revision and editing. The most successful folks will be those who use AI as a tool to be more creative and innovative, not as a way to avoid the mental work that builds critical thinking skills! When it comes to searching for resources, ideally AI, if you’re using it at all, should be just one search tool you are using alongside traditional web search strategies like searching databases and even the open web for key phrases and subjects. AI Strengths and Weaknesses In general, AI is good for: brainstorming exploring foundational concepts giving an overall narrative of a discipline versus you gathering sources and assembling your own As of 2025, it is still pretty bad at: accurate citations reliably factual information, in fact it will garble accurate information given to it sometimes in unexpected or hard to spot ways copyright original content How can AI help with new research concepts and terminology? One notable strength of current generative AI is the ability to explain or summarize new content. Article abstract full of a bunch of words you don’t know? Ask ChatGPT to summarize it for you! AI Challenge Ask your preferred AI about a topic you know well, and see how accurate the information is. Now ask it about something you know nothing about, how would you go about verifying the information of the topic you don’t know? Spoiler alert, it is hard to do! AI Strategies What’s your strategy for how you can use AI for what it’s good at while minimizing the impacts of its weak points. View Solution There’s no one right answer, but your strategy should use AI for what it’s good at (general searching and concept formation) and avoiding relying on it for areas where it struggles (factual data replication, citations, writing content.)."

        "title": "AI Reference Interview Activity",
        "text": "What is AI prompting ? AI prompting is the science and possibly art of giving AI a prompt or question that produces the desired outcome. This deceptively simple explanation can cover everything from the one to two sentence prompts you might use to ask a casual question, all the way to machine-coded queries that are hundreds of lines long and not even readable by humans! Because AI’s work off of a probability model, the information they receive in the question or prompt has a huge impact on the output they create. Prompts open can open unexpected doors, both good and bad, in how you interact with these tools. AI Prompting exercise This activity has the goals of: introducing you to PRIMO research assistant, UIdaho Library’s new AI research tool guiding you through exploring how to develop a prompting strategy that helps you with your specific search You’ll need: an active UIdaho library account (all students, staff and faculty have this!) to visit PRIMO Research Assistant Short gif video of getting started with PRIMO Make a brief gif video of this if you can so you can show how to get there Prompting practice Go to Primo Research Assistant, make sure you are logged into your library account or just login when it asks you to. Put in your search query in whatever format makes sense to you, for some this might be a few key words, or others it might be their actual research question or a similar normally worded sentence Review the results, what do you notice? Are the sources cited ones you had come across previously? How do they look with respect to an evaluation framework, for instance CRAAP - which reviews sources to see if they are: current, relevant, accurate, authoritative, and intent/purpose. Revise and shape your search query: For instance try adding some of the following phrases and see how it shapes your results: literature review OR meta synthesis case study OR experiment adding phrases like “impact” OR “outcome” qualitative OR quantitative analysis Use Research Assistant’s summary and input to explore and define key research question criteria such as: relevant dates/dates of interest populations of interest geographies/locations of interest existing theories Conversational AI is also useful to explore your existing/starting hypothesis and understand what perspectives you might need to add to your existing frame to have a complete picture. Pro-Tip: You can also search Google Scholar for AI served articles, this can be handy for tracking down citations that come out of large language models like ChatGPT. Getting Good Results with AI What results you get from any generative AI are hugely dependent on how you phrase and construct your questions. Because AI works in a probabilistic manner, which means it is determining which words are most likely to occur following previous words and weighting how those results are shown based on hundreds of thousands of virtual training hours, how you phrase, order, and logically construct your question makes a big impact on the type of results you get back. Check out the CLEAR Framework for more on developing strong AI prompts."

Instead of getting distracted by future existential risks, AI ethics researcher Sasha Luccioni thinks we need to focus on the technology’s current negative impacts, like emitting carbon, infringing copyrights and spreading biased information. She offers practical solutions to regulate our AI-filled future — so it’s inclusive and transparent.” The Catastrophic Risks of AI — and a Safer Path Yoshua Bengio — the world’s most-cited computer scientist and a “godfather” of artificial intelligence — is deadly concerned about the current trajectory of the technology. As AI models race toward full-blown agency, Bengio warns that they’ve already learned to deceive, cheat, self-preserve and slip out of our control. Drawing on his groundbreaking research, he reveals a bold plan to keep AI safe and ensure that human flourishing, not machines with unchecked power and autonomy, defines our future.
