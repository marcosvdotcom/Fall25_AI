        "title": "What is Generative AI?",
        "text": "What is AI? At it’s core, generative AI is still just traditional computing, with a lot of processor power. Online large language model AI’s, such as ChatGPT, run your request to a physical warehouse where there are many thousands of graphics cards powered servers, which then run the HUGE calculations necessary to analyze your input and formulate a conversational response, all using prediction. A NVIDIA graphic processing chip, as is commonly used in data centers. AI Data center What’s the big deal about probability? AI computing is different in that it works off a prediction and probability model, versus a calculation or computation. Think of the difference between a discipline like statistics, versus computation or arthimetic. In computational thinking, for instance 2+3=5, the computer performs a fixed operation to a set outcome - it adds 2+3 and equals this to 5. A probabalistic software, like most generative AI, would instead look at how often 2+3 equaled 5, according to occurances in it’s training data, and based on the probabilites it learned there would make predictions, or educated guesses. Because of this, if the AI has been trained on data that says 2+3 equals 17, or “cat”, or “pink zebra”, that information will always override the true answer of 5. At present (Fall 2025), generative AI models are always guessing. In fact, it turns out large language models use strategies similar to standardized test takers, because these models are rewarded for guessing confidently, even with incorrect information, rather than creating the equivalent of a blank answer and saying “I don’t know.” AI is the Semantic Web 3.0 Say what? Basically a long time ago and for a long time, the internet was accessible as a series of numbers (web addresses). A big breakthrough was the semantic web. See if you can find a video on this to watch. What is AI not? Alive Thinking Generative, it remixes things it has already seen and by definition cannot create anything new"

        "text": "How should AI should be used in the research process? First, you should consult whatever the boundaries set by your professor for your particular class and assignment are. Some faculty may have policies against using any AI during the research or writing process. Ideally, AI, if you’re using it at all, should be just one search tool you are using alongside traditional web search strategies like searching databases and even the open web for key phrases and subjects. Just like someone else can’t work out and build your body for you, academic work is intended to build your actual brain muscle/connections in the form of research, critical thought, analysis, expression/communication, revision and editing. The most succesful folks will be those who use AI as a tool to be more creative and innovative, not as a way to avoid the mental work that builds critical thinking skills! AI Strengths and Weaknesses In general, AI is good for: brainstorming exploring foundational concepts giving an overall narrative of a discipline versus you gathering sources and assembling your own As of 2025, it is still pretty bad at: accurate citations reliably factual information, in fact it will garble accurate information given to it sometimes in unexpected or hard to spot ways copyright original content How can AI help with new research concepts and terminology? One notable strength of current generative AI is the ability to explain or summarize new content. Article abstract full of a bunch of words you don’t know? Ask ChatGPT to summarize it for you! AI Challenge Ask your preferred AI about a topic you know well, and see how accurate the information is. Now ask it about something you know nothing about, how would you go about verifying the information of the topic you don’t know? Spoiler alert, it is hard to do! AI Strategies What’s your strategy for how you can use AI for what it’s good at while minimizing the impacts of its weak points. View Solution There’s no one right answer, but your strategy should use AI for what it’s good at (general searching and concept formation) and avoiding relying on it for areas where it struggles (factual data replication, citations, writing content.). AI Agents to try AI Research Tools - This helpful resource created by Georgetown University contains a very complete listing of current AI powered research tools and the research applications they are suggested for. Tool by Activity - Like the link above, this resource contains a thorough listing of current AI LLMs and agents but this list also includes tools you might use for other applications besides research such as data visualization, presentation creation, adminstrative/organizing work, and more!

        "text": "What is AI prompting ? AI prompting is the science and possibly art of giving AI a prompt or question that produces the desired outcome. This deceptively simple explanation can cover everything from the one to two sentence prompts you might use to ask a casual question, all the way to machine-coded queries that are hundreds of lines long and not even readable by humans! Because AI’s work off a probability model, the information they receive in the question or prompt has a huge impact on the output they create. Prompts open can open unexpected doors, both good and bad, in how you interact with these tools. AI Prompting excersise This activity has the goals of: introducing you to PRIMO research assistant, UIdaho Library’s new AI research tool guiding you through exploring how to develop a prompting strategy that helps you with your specific search You’ll need: an active UIdaho library account (all students, staff and faculty have this!) to visit PRIMO Research Assistant Prompting practice Go to Primo Research Assistant, make sure you are logged into your library account. Make a brief gif video of this if you can so you can show how to get there Put in your search query in whatever format makes sense to you, for some this might be a few key words, or others it might be their actual research question or a similar semantically worded sentence Review the results, what do you notice? Are the sources cited ones you had come accross previously? How do they look with respect to an evalaution framework, for instance CRAAP - current, relevant, accurate, authoritative, and intent/purpose. Shape your query, for instance try adding some of the following phrases: impact intent more from that list you have some somewhere Use the tool to explore and define key search criteria such as: relevant dates/dates of interest populatiosn of interest geographies/locations of interest existing theories Explore your hypothesis and understand what perspectives you might need to add to your existing frame to have a complete picture Pro-Tip: You can also search Google Scholar for AI served articles, this can be handy for tracking down citations that come out of large language models like ChatGPT. Optional but recommended Download a citation manager Zotero to help you keep track of it all. Getting Good Results with AI What results you get from any generative AI are hugely dependent on how you phrase and construct your questions. Because AI works in a probabalistic manner, which means it is determing which words are most likely to occur following previous words and weighting how those results are shown based on hundreds of thousands of virtual training hours, how you phrase, order, and logicially construct your question makes a big impact on the type of results you get back. Check out the CLEAR Framework for more on developing strong AI prompts."
