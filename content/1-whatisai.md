## What is AI?

At it's core, generative AI is still just traditional computing, with a lot of processor power.

Online large language model AI's, such as ChatGPT, run your request to a physical warehouse where there are many thousands of graphics cards powered servers, which then run the HUGE calculations necessary to analyze your input and formulate a conversational response, all using prediction.

## What's the big deal about probability?

AI computing _is_ different in that it works off a prediction and probability model, versus a calculation or computation. Think of the difference between a discipline like statistics, versus computation or arthimetic. In computational thinking, for instance 2+3=5, the computer performs a fixed operation to a set outcome - it adds 2+3 and equals this to 5. 

A probabalistic software, like most generative AI, would instead look at how often 2+3 equaled 5, according to occurances in it's training data, and based on the probabilites it learned there would make predictions, or educated guesses. Because of this, if the AI has been trained on data that says 2+3 equals 17, or "cat", or "pink zebra", that information will always override the true answer of 5.

At present (Fall 2025), generative AI models are _always_ guessing. In fact, it turns out large language models use strategies similar to standardized test takers, because these models are rewarded for guessing confidently, even with incorrect information, rather than creating the equivalent of a blank answer and saying "I don't know."

## AI is the Semantic Web 3.0 

Say what? Basically a long time ago and for a long time, the internet was accessible as a series of numbers (web addresses). A big breakthrough was the semantic web. See if you can find a video on this to watch. 

## What is AI _not_?

- Alive
- Thinking
- Generative, it remixes things it has already seen and by definition cannot create anything new
