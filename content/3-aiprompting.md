## What is AI prompting ?

AI prompting is the science and possibly art of giving AI a prompt or question that produces the desired outcome. This deceptively simple explanation can cover everything from the one to two sentence prompts you might use to ask a casual question, all the way to machine-coded queries that are hundreds of lines long and not even readable by humans!

Because AI's work off a probability model, the information they receive in the question or prompt has a huge impact on the output they create. Prompts open can open unexpected doors, both good and bad, in how you interact with these tools.

## AI Prompting excersise

This activity has the goals of:

- introducing you to PRIMO research assistant, UIdaho Library's new AI research tool 
- guiding you through exploring how to develop a prompting strategy that helps you with your specific search 

You'll need:

- an active UIdaho library account (all students, staff and faculty have this!)

- to visit [PRIMO Research Assistant](https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/researchAssistant?vid=01ALLIANCE_UID%3AUID)

## Prompting practice

1. Go to Primo Research Assistant, make sure you are logged into your library account. _Make a brief gif video of this if you can so you can show how to get there_
1. Put in your search query in whatever format makes sense to you, for some this might be a few key words, or others it might be their actual research question or a similar semantically worded sentence 
1. Review the results, what do you notice? Are the sources cited ones you had come accross previously? How do they look with respect to an evalaution framework, for instance CRAAP - current, relevant, accurate, authoritative, and intent/purpose.
1. Shape your query, for instance try adding some of the following phrases:
	- impact
	- intent
	- more from that list you have some somewhere
1. Use the tool to explore and define key search criteria such as:
	- relevant dates/dates of interest
	- populatiosn of interest
	- geographies/locations of interest
	- existing theories
1. Explore your hypothesis and understand what perspectives you might need to add to your existing frame to have a complete picture 

Pro-Tip: _You can also search Google Scholar for AI served articles, this can be handy for tracking down citations that come out of large language models like ChatGPT._

### Optional but recommended 
- Download a citation manager [Zotero](https://Zotero.org) to help you keep track of it all. 

## Getting Good Results with AI

What results you get from any generative AI are hugely dependent on how you phrase and construct your questions. Because AI works in a probabalistic manner, which means it is determing which words are most likely to occur following previous words and weighting how those results are shown based on hundreds of thousands of virtual training hours, how you phrase, order, and logicially construct your question makes a big impact on the type of results you get back.
