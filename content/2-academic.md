## How should AI should be used in the research process?

First, you should consult whatever the boundaries set by your professor for your particular class and assignment are. Some faculty may have policies against using any AI during the research or writing process. 

Ideally, AI, if you're using it at all, should be just one search tool you are using alongside traditional web search strategies like searching databases and even the open web for key phrases and subjects. 

> Just like someone else can’t work out and build your body for you, academic work is intended to build your actual brain muscle/connections in the form of research, critical thought, analysis, expression/communication, revision and editing. The most succesful folks will be those who use AI as a tool to be _more_ creative and innovative, not as a way to avoid the mental work that builds critical thinking skills!

## AI Strengths and Weaknesses

In general, AI is good for: 
- brainstorming
- exploring foundational concepts
- giving an overall narrative of a discipline versus you gathering sources and assembling your own

As of 2025, it is still pretty bad at:
- accurate citations
- reliably factual information, in fact it will garble accurate information given to it sometimes in unexpected or hard to spot ways
- copyright
- original content 

## How can AI help with new research concepts and terminology?

One notable strength of current generative AI is the ability to explain or summarize new content. Article abstract full of a bunch of words you don't know? Ask ChatGPT to summarize it for you!


## AI Challenge 

1. Ask your preferred AI about a topic you know well, and see how accurate the information is. 
1. Now ask it about something you know nothing about, how would you go about verifying the information of the topic you don’t know? Spoiler alert, it is hard to do!

## AI Agents to try 

[AI Research Tools ](https://guides.library.georgetown.edu/ai/tools) - This helpful resource created by Georgetown University contains a very complete listing of current AI powered research tools and the research applications they are suggested for. 

[Tool by Activity](https://cndls.georgetown.edu/resources/ai/using-ai/#ai-tool-by-activity) - Like the link above, this resource contains a thorough listing of current AI LLMs and agents but this list also includes tools you might use for other applications besides research such as data visualization, presentation creation, adminstrative/organizing work, and more!

[Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) - Free, AI powered database that a lot of academic AI agents run off. 

[Open Alex](https://openalex.org/) - AI powered global research catalog.
