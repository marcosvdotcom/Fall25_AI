## AI Ethics and Risks

- [AI Is Dangerous, but Not for the Reasons You Think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXdVDhOGqoE)
    <br> "AI won't kill us all — but that doesn't make it trustworthy. Instead of getting distracted by future existential risks, AI ethics researcher Sasha Luccioni thinks we need to focus on the technology's current negative impacts, like emitting carbon, infringing copyrights and spreading biased information. She offers practical solutions to regulate our AI-filled future — so it's inclusive and transparent."

- [The Catastrophic Risks of AI — and a Safer Path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe9QSCF-d88&t=120s)
    <br> Yoshua Bengio — the world's most-cited computer scientist and a "godfather" of artificial intelligence — is deadly concerned about the current trajectory of the technology. As AI models race toward full-blown agency, Bengio warns that they've already learned to deceive, cheat, self-preserve and slip out of our control. Drawing on his groundbreaking research, he reveals a bold plan to keep AI safe and ensure that human flourishing, not machines with unchecked power and autonomy, defines our future. (Recorded at TED2025 on April 8, 2025)
